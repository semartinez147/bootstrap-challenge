# Bootstrap Challenge
This is an assignment from Deep Dive Coding Fullstack Cohort 33.

## Summary
Reinforced practice of Bootstrap's grid system. HTML trial by fire. Referencing documentation under pressure.

## Brief
1. Create a one-page layout based on the wireframes in the img directory. This layout should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
2. Use Bootstrap's built-in classes to the greatest extent possible for style. Add custom styling of your own only after all Bootstrap possibilities have been exhausted.
3. Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
4. You can copy snippets from the Bootstrap Official Documentation where you need to, but otherwise create this layout from scratch.
5. Load ALL CSS dependencies in the HTML <head> tag and all javascript dependencies in the bottom of the <body> tag.
