# Bootstrap Challenge
This is the starter code for the Bootstrap Challenge assignment.

## Objective
Reinforced practice of Bootstrap's grid system. HTML trial by fire. Referencing documentation under pressure.

## Rules
1. Create a new project that contains ONE PAGE that successfully implements the layout shown in the wireframes in the img direcotry. This layout should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
2. Use Bootstrap's built-in classes to the greatest extent possible for style. Add custom styling of your own only after all Bootstrap possibilities have been exhausted.
3. Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
4. You can copy snippets from the Bootstrap Official Documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built templates, other websites, or existing projects! The challenge here is to create this layout from scratch.
5. Load ALL CSS dependencies in the HTML <head> tag and and all javascript dependencies in the bottom of the <body> tag. Why? Because your technical lead said so. :P

Source your dependencies and resources as needed, and use the Bootstrap documentation freely. Do not use example projects, pre-built templates, tutorials, or third-party code snippets as a head start. All of your new co-workers will know if you do.

**Code taken from the official Bootstrap documentation, FontAwesome documentation, and CDN links excepted.**
